## Overview

This repository contains links to course slides hosted on a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AEt-lrxRcV2G_SAfA0isPpj6omJ7M7Qr?usp=drive_link), Jupyter notebooks and supporting materials for 2-day course on infrastructure mapping and analysis.

The course will introduce the methodology used by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to measure gaps in ICT infrastructure and for connectivity business planning.â€¯ It aims to improve the theoretical and practical skills of participants in collecting ICT infrastructure data, identifying underserved areas, applying GIS tools, and using connectivity models to test and compare selected connectivity scenarios. 

During practical hands-on sessions, participants will learn how to source and prepare their own data using data dictionaries and common standards. The sessions will cover topics such as exploratory data analysis, data validation, visualization, and more advanced topics like visibility analysis for point-to-point connectivity and fiber path analysis. The training will involve practical sessions where participants will gain hands-on experience using QGIS and Jupyter Notebooks, working through real-life case studies related to school connectivity.â€¯ 

## Data

This course uses a case study of school connectivity in **Windhoek**, the capital of Namibia. While you'll learn to collect and process this data during the training, we provide pre-processed datasets at different stages to help you follow along.

### Data Repository

All training data is available in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ANcLWuLDko8nnKuwaYU1S3QH8I8PIwT6?usp=drive_link), organized into the following subfolders:

- **raw/**: Original data as downloaded from various sources, before any processing
- **standardized/**: Cleaned and formatted data following ITU standards and data dictionaries, ready for analysis 
- **outputs/**: Results from different analyses (proximity, coverage, demand, etc.)
- **raster/**: Geographic raster files for elevation and population density
